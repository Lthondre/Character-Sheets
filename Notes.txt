CONSIDER WORKING WITH SQL INSTEAD OF SHIT-TIER ACCESS

after you select a weapon/armor, weapon stats need to be applied to character
	need to augment character base stats by their modifiers before weapon stats
	need to implement ability modifiers on weapons/armor

need to add class powers. try to do in access
	see phone for DnD 4e wiki on each classes powers
	change text property so that classes power title
		-Spells/Prayers/Exploits (Arcane/Divine/Martial)
	click button, see all powers at or below current level
	keep small files per user on how many non-cantrip spells they've used
		-check every day
		-total allowed/day | total used today
	
still closes frmCharSheet after error
	do-while loop does not counter this

frmCharSheet save statements can probably look better

format string works fine in console, looks like shit in list box	

need following calculated fields on random roll:
	Action Points

needs gui

does not change things levelling down

release versions need proper connection string.
	it is in comments in mdlGlobal
