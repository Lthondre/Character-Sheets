		-check every day
		-total allowed/day | total used today
began implementing powers
	-reads correctly from database
	-need to recieve player calss and level from frmCharSheet

need following calculated fields on random roll:
	Action Points

release versions need proper connection string.
	it is in comments in mdlGlobal
