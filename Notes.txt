CONSIDER WORKING WITH SQL INSTEAD OF SHIT-TIER ACCESS

armor is not saving correctly
	datagrid is being sorted with Unequipped(AID:1) at the bottom
		save statement will always save new armor with AID:2 this way
	need to find highest AID in database

after you select a weapon/armor, weapon stats need to be applied to character
	need to augment character base stats by their modifiers before weapon stats

still closes frmCharSheet after error

frmCharSheet save statements can probably look better

format string works fine in console, looks like shit in list box	

need following calculated fields on random roll:
	Armor Class
	Initiative
	Perception
	Action Points

need to calculate carrying capacity
	weapon/armor weight
	1cp=1/50lb	copper piece	  1cp
	1sp=1/50lb	silver piece	 10cp
	1gp=1/50lb	gold piece	 10sp
	1pp=1/50lb	platinum piece	100gp

needs gui

release versions need proper connection string.
