CONSIDER WORKING WITH SQL INSTEAD OF SHIT-TIER ACCESS

after you select a weapon/armor, weapon stats need to be applied to character
	need to augment character base stats by their modifiers before weapon stats

still closes frmCharSheet after error
	do-while loop does not counter this

frmCharSheet save statements can probably look better

format string works fine in console, looks like shit in list box	

need following calculated fields on random roll:
	Initiative
	Perception
	Action Points

needs gui

release versions need proper connection string.
	it is in comments in mdlGlobal
