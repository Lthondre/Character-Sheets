CONSIDER WORKING WITH SQL INSTEAD OF SHIT-TIER ACCESS

after you select a weapon/armor, weapon stats need to be applied to character
	need to augment character base stats by their modifiers before weapon stats

need to add race/class mods

need to add class powers. try to do in access
	see phone for DnD 4e wiki on each classes powers
	change text to that classes power title e.g. Wizards and the like have spells, 				Clerics have prayers, etc.
	click button, see all powers at or below current level
	keep small files per user on how many non-cantrip spells they've used
		check every day
	
still closes frmCharSheet after error
	do-while loop does not counter this

frmCharSheet save statements can probably look better

format string works fine in console, looks like shit in list box	

need following calculated fields on random roll:
	*Initiative
	*Perception
	Color
	Skill rolls
	Action Points

needs gui

release versions need proper connection string.
