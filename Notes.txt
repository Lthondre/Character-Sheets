CONSIDER WORKING WITH SQL INSTEAD OF SHIT-TIER ACCESS

need to add class powers. try to do in access
	keep small files per user on how many non-cantrip spells they've used
		-check every day
		-total allowed/day | total used today
	appends two copies of spell/spell left on cellDoubleClick
	
frmCharSheet save statements can probably look better

format string works fine in console, looks like shit in list box

need to append used spells to [pid].pow	

need following calculated fields on random roll:
	Action Points

release versions need proper connection string.
	it is in comments in mdlGlobal

No skills
No feats

No gods No Kings
